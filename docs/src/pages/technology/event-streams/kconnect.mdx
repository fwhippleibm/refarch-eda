## Overview

This lab will address multiple scenarios that aim to build an end to end data pipeline, as depicted by the following figure, using Event Streams on Cloud. At the high level Kafka connect is used to integrate external systems into the Kafka ecosystem. For example external system can inject message to queue manager, from which a first Kafka source connector will get the message to a Kafka topic, which then will be processed by a series of event driven microservices down to a final topic, that will be use by Sink connectors.

![1](./images/kconnect-overview.png)

To support this lab we are reusing a classical business use case where stores are sending their transactions to a central messaging platform, based on queues, and with the adoption of loosely coupled microservice, real time analytics and complex event processing, Kafka is added to the legacy environment. Adopting Kafka connect lets integrate with existing applications without any changes. 

## Solution anatomy

The lab is divided into scenarios that can be combined to support the real time inventory data pipeline as illustrated in the figure below:

![2](./images/kconnect-scenario-components.png) 

1. The store application, is a Quarkus based app, generating item sales to RabbitMQ `items` queue. The code of this application is under the `store-sale-producer` folder, in the [lab repository](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/eda-kconnect-lab/). We will address how to get this code in the pre-requisite section.

    * RabbitMQ runs in docker image started locally via docker compose. The messages are in the `items` queue.
    * The lab, focusing on the injection to Kafka, is documented in the [scenario 2](#scenario-2:-rabbitmq-on-premise-to-event-streams-on-cloud-via-rabbitmq-connector-source).
    * [A] The Sink connector description is in the [kconnect](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/eda-kconnect-lab/tree/master/kconnect) folder.
    * Kafka backbone is Event Streams on Cloud.
1. The inventory MS is a Kafka Stream application, done with Reactive Messaging and Kafka Stream API. The folder is  
For example the scenario illustrate JDBC Sink connector to save to existing data base.
1. The mock up Inventory mainframe application is not implemented and we will use the MQ tools to view the message in the `inventory` queue 

    * The MQ Sink connector [B] configuration is defined in the [kconnect](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/eda-kconnect-lab/tree/master/kconnect) folder.
    * MQ broker runs in docker container started with docker-compose
    * The lab scenario is [the number 1](#scenario-1:-event-streams-on-cloud-to-mq-on-premise-via-mq-connector-sink)
1. The Inventory Application, using DB2 as datasource is a quarkus app using hibernate with panache, defined in the [nventory-app](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/eda-kconnect-lab/tree/master/inventory-app) folder

    * The JDBC Sink connector [C] configuration is defined in the [kconnect](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/eda-kconnect-lab/tree/master/kconnect) folder.
    * The [scenario 3](#scenario-3:-event-streams-on-cloud-to-db2-on-premise-via-jdbc-sink-connector) lab goes over how the Kafka Connect JDBC sink works.
1. The [scenario 4](#scenario-4:-run-the-solution-components-end-to-end-on-kubernetes) addresses the end to end solution, which is basically an end to end demonstration of a simple data pipeline for a real time view of an inventory solution. 

<InlineNotification kind="info">You need to decide what your 'on-premise' environment is for this lab. You can run with docker compose, or deploy on a premise cluster. We propose to run the components with docker compose for the scenario 1,2,3 and scenario 4 is for a deployment of the components on a kubernetes cluster that could run on premise or on any cloud provider using Openshift. If you do not want to build all the components, we have each of them available in docker hub and the docker compose file should run them automatically.
</InlineNotification>

## General pre-requisites

We need the following IBM Cloud services created and tools to run the lab. We try to use docker images as much as possible to do not impact your local laptop.

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and docker compose to run the solution locally.
* Event Streams instance, may be reuse the one created in [this lab](./es-cloud/).
* [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started).
* If you want to run locally you need to get [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
* [git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

For the on-premise environment, we will not use VMs, but simply run some of the components on IBM premise Service platform or Openshift. The point is that the workload is packaged as container images and can run anywhere.

## Scenario setup

1. Login to the cloud via CLI: `ibmcloud login`
1. Initialize the Event Streams CLI and select the target Event Streams cluster: `ibmcloud es init`
1. If not done before using UI or from previous work add the following topics:
    * `ibmcloud es topic-create connect-configs`
    * `ibmcloud es topic-create connect-offsets`
    * `ibmcloud es topic-create connect-status`
    * `ibmcloud es topic-create inventory`
    * `ibmcloud es topic-create items`
1. Create API KEY with a manager-level access.
1. Clone the lab repository: `git clone https://github.com/jbcodeforce/eda-kconnect-lab && cd eda-kconnect-lab`.
1. Prepare the script to set the environment variables used by all the components of the solution, like the Kafka broker URLs and APIKEy. 

    * First rename the `scripts/setenv-TMP.sh` to `scripts/setenv.sh` 
    * Then modify the KAFKA_BROKERS and KAFKA_APIKEY with the respecting values as defined in the Event Streams credentials.

  ```json
  {
    "api_key": "bA ... Qp",
    "apikey": "bA ... Qp",
    "iam_apikey_description": "Auto-generated for key 4d ... c6",
    "iam_apikey_name": "es-mgr-creds",
    "iam_role_crn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Manager",
    "iam_serviceid_crn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam-identity::a/db ... f2::serviceid:ServiceId-7a ... 6d",
    "instance_id": "29 ... 15",
    "kafka_admin_url": "https://70 ... 1g.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com",
    "kafka_brokers_sasl": [
      "broker-1- ... kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093",
      "broker-0- ... kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093",
      "broker-4- ... kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093",
      "broker-2- ... kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093",
      "broker-5- ... kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093",
      "broker-3- ... kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093"
    ],
    "kafka_http_url": "https://70 ... 1g.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com",
    "password": "bA ... Qp",
    "user": "token"
  }
  ```

1. Prepare the Kafka Connect environment, as we need to use three connectors. Therefore we need to clone the source, build and get the jars file in the connectors. In fact we have developed scripts to automate those tedious steps:

  * Under the `kconnect` folder run `./setupConnectors.sh` script and get the three connectors downloaded and built.
  * Build a docker image for the connector: this is also done by running a second script: `./createOrStartKconnect.sh build`.

<InlineNotification kind="info">You need to decide what 'on-premise' environment is for this lab. You can run with docker compose, or deploy on a premise cluster. We propose to run the components with docker compose for the scenario 1,2,3 and do a deployment of the components on premise as a service on scenario 4.

## Scenario 1: Event Streams on Cloud to MQ on premise via MQ connector sink

This scenario uses the [IBM Kafka Connect sink connector for IBM MQ](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/kafka-connect-mq-sink) to pull streaming data into a local MQ queue.  In this example we are using IBM Event Streams on IBM Cloud as the Kafka data source and a dockerized instance of MQ as the destination. We could have used MQ broker as part of Cloud Pak for integration or [as a service in IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/mqcloud/index.html).

### Pre-requisites

We assume that you have an instance of Event Streams already running on IBM Cloud with at least on manager-level credentials created.  The credentials will come in the form of a JSON document as seen in the previous section.
You will need the `kafka_brokers_sasl` and `password` atribute to configure the sink connector.

This scenario uses the `inventory` topic created in the Scenario Setup in previous section.

### Create Local IBM MQ Instance

Here we will use Docker to create a local MQ instance.  First create a data directory to mount in the container.

`mkdir qm1data`

Then create the container.

```shell
docker run                     \
  --name mq                    \
  --detach                     \
  --publish 1414:1414          \
  --publish 9443:9443          \
  --publish 9157:9157          \
  --volume qm1data:/mnt/mqm    \
  --env LICENSE=accept         \
  --env MQ_QMGR_NAME=QM1       \
  --env MQ_APP_PASSWORD=admin  \
  --env MQ_ENABLE_METRICS=true \
  ibmcom/mq
```

You should be able to log into the MQ server on port 9443 with default user `admin` and password `passw0rd`.

Connect to the running MQ instance to create a Channel and Queue as described on the [Using IBM MQ with Kafka Connect](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/kafka-connect-mq-sink/blob/master/UsingMQwithKafkaConnect.md) page.

```shell
docker exec -ti mq bash
strmqm QM1
runmqsc QM1
DEFINE CHANNEL(KAFKA.CHANNEL) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN)
SET CHLAUTH(KAFKA.CHANNEL) TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST('nobody')
SET CHLAUTH('*') TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS('*') USERSRC(NOACCESS)
SET CHLAUTH(KAFKA.CHANNEL) TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS('*') USERSRC(CHANNEL) CHCKCLNT(REQUIRED)
ALTER AUTHINFO(SYSTEM.DEFAULT.AUTHINFO.IDPWOS) AUTHTYPE(IDPWOS) ADOPTCTX(YES)
REFRESH SECURITY TYPE(CONNAUTH)
DEFINE QLOCAL(ITEMS)
SET AUTHREC OBJTYPE(QMGR) PRINCIPAL('admin') AUTHADD(CONNECT,INQ)
SET AUTHREC PROFILE(ITEMS) OBJTYPE(QUEUE) PRINCIPAL('admin') AUTHADD(ALLMQI)
END
```

Exit the session and continue on to create the MQ Connector Sink.

### Create MQ Kafka Connector Sink

The MQ Connector Sink can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/kafka-connect-mq-sink).  The Github site includes exhaustive instructions and an abridged version follows.

Clone the repository with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/ibm-messaging/kafka-connect-mq-sink.git`

Change directory into the kafka-connect-mq-sink directory:

`cd kafka-connect-mq-sink`

Build the connector using Maven:

`mvn clean package`

Next, create a directory to contain the Kafka Connector configuration.

`mkdir config && cd config`

Create a configuration file called `connect-distributed.properties` for Kafka Connect based on the template below.

```properties
# A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster.
bootstrap.servers=broker-1- ... kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-0- ... kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-4- ... kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-2- ... kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-5- ... kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-3- ... kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093

group.id=mq-sink-cluster

# The converters specify the format of data in Kafka and how to translate it into Connect data. Every Connect user will
# need to configure these based on the format they want their data in when loaded from or stored into Kafka
key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter
value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter
# Converter-specific settings can be passed in by prefixing the Converter's setting with the converter we want to apply
# it to
key.converter.schemas.enable=true
value.converter.schemas.enable=true

# Topic to use for storing offsets. T
offset.storage.topic=connect-offsets
offset.storage.replication.factor=3
#offset.storage.partitions=25

# Topic to use for storing connector and task configurations; note that this should be a single partition, highly replicated, and compacted topic.
config.storage.topic=connect-configs
config.storage.replication.factor=3

# Topic to use for storing statuses. This topic can have multiple partitions and should be replicated and compacted.
status.storage.topic=connect-status
status.storage.replication.factor=3
status.storage.partitions=5

# Flush much faster than normal, which is useful for testing/debugging
offset.flush.interval.ms=10000
```

Save this file in the `config` directory.

Next, create a log4j configuration file named `connect-log4j.properties` based on the template below.

```properties
log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, stdout

log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=[%d] %p %m (%c:%L)%n

log4j.logger.org.apache.kafka=INFO
```

Save this file to the `config` directory as well.

Finally, create a JSON configuraiton file for the MQ sink.  This can be stored anywhere but it can be conveniently created in the `config` directory.  We name this file `mq-sink.json`.

```
{
    "name": "mq-sink",
    "config":
    {
        "connector.class": "com.ibm.eventstreams.connect.mqsink.MQSinkConnector",
        "tasks.max": "1",
        "topics": "inventory",

        "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
        "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",

        "mq.queue.manager": "QM1",
        "mq.connection.name.list": "mq(1414)",
        "mq.user.name": "admin",
        "mq.password": "passw0rd",
        "mq.user.authentication.mqcsp": true,
        "mq.channel.name": "KAFKA.CHANNEL",
        "mq.queue": "INVENTORY",
        "mq.message.builder": "com.ibm.eventstreams.connect.mqsink.builders.DefaultMessageBuilder"
    }
}
```

Back out one directory to the `kafka-connect-mq-sink` directory.

`cd ..`

Finally, run the Kafka Connect MQ Sink container.

```
docker run                                 \
  --name mq-sink                           \
  --detach                                 \
  --volume $(pwd)/config:/opt/kafka/config \
  --publish 8083:8083                      \
  --link mq:mq                             \
  kafkaconnect-with-mq-sink:1.3.0
```

You should now have a working MQ sink.

## Scenario 2: Rabbitmq on premise to Event Streams on Cloud via RabbitMQ connector source

In this scenario we are using the [IBM messaging github: source connector for RabbitMQ](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/kafka-connect-rabbitmq-source). The configuration for this connector is also done using Json config file, with a POST to the Kafka connectors URL.

The [lab repository](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/eda-kconnect-lab) includes a docker compose file (`RabbitMQ-Kconnect-compose.yaml`) under the `infrastructure` folder to run Rabbit MQ and Kconnect together on your local computer. 

In scenario 1, we were using the official IBM MQ Connector docker image, but in this scenario we have to define a Kafka connect image that includes the RabbitMQ and JDBC connectors. Which means we needs to get the different connector jar files, and build a docker image. Those steps were described in [previous section](#scenario-setup).

### Start the backend environment

In this section we start RabbitMQ, Kafka Connect and the Store Item Sale generator app. This app exposes a REST api to generate items sale operations that happen in a predefined set of stores.

Under the infrastructure folder use the command: `docker-compose -f RabbitMQ-Kconnect-compose.yaml up`

The trace includes RabbitMQ logs, storeSaleGenerator_1 and Kafka connect. Here is a small extract of important messages:

```shell
rabbitmq_1            | 2020-06-17 06:12:58.293 [info] <0.9.0> Server startup complete; 4 plugins started.
rabbitmq_1            |  * rabbitmq_management

rabbitmq_1            |  * rabbitmq_amqp1_0
rabbitmq_1            |  completed with 4 plugins.
.... 
storeSaleGenerator_1  | 2020-06-17 06:12:44,056 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Profile prod activated. 
storeSaleGenerator_1  | 2020-06-17 06:12:44,057 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Installed features: [cdi, mutiny, resteasy, resteasy-jsonb, smallrye-openapi, smallrye-reactive-messaging, smallrye-reactive-messaging-amqp, vertx]
```

### Verify the RabbitMQ settings

In a Web Browser go to [http://localhost:1567/](http://localhost:1567/) using the guest/guest login. 

You should reach this console:

![7](./images/rabbitmq-overview.png)

Add a bew admin user: **rabbit-user/rabbit-pass** using the Admin tab. Enable the virtual host to be '/'.

![](./images/rabbitmq-user.png)

Go to the Queue tab and add `items` queue with default parameters:

![8](./images/rabbitmq-item-queue.png)


With the following result

![9](./images/rabbitmq-item-queue-2.png)


### Configure the kafka connector for Rabbitmq source 

The `rabbitmq-source.json` define the connector and the RabbitMQ connection parameters:

```json
{
    "name": "RabbitMQSourceConnector",
    "config": {
        "connector.class": "com.ibm.eventstreams.connect.rabbitmqsource.RabbitMQSourceConnector",
        "tasks.max": "1",
        "kafka.topic" : "items",
        "rabbitmq.host": "rabbitmq",
        "rabbitmq.queue" : "items",
        "rabbitmq.prefetch.count" : "500",
        "rabbitmq.automatic.recovery.enabled" : "true",
        "rabbitmq.network.recovery.interval.ms" : "10000",
        "rabbitmq.topology.recovery.enabled" : "true"
    }
}
```

This file is uploaded to Kafka Connect via a PORT operation:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8083/connectors   --data "@./rabbitmq-source.json"
```

To verify use: `curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/connectors`

### Generate sale messages

The Store application has an OpenAPI definition so using the following URL we can access the `/stores/start/2` api:

![5](./images/store-app-1.png)

Or use `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/stores/start/2`

### Verify messages arrived in Kafka items topic

We can use the Kafdrop tool to go to the `items` topic as illustrated below. The tool can be started via the `./startKafdrop.sh` command under the `infrastructure` folder after setting a `kakfa.properties` file as:

```properties
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
ssl.protocol=TLSv1.2
ssl.enabled.protocols=TLSv1.2
ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm=HTTPS
sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="token" password="APIKEY";
```

![](./images/kafdrop.png)


## Scenario 3: Event Streams on Cloud to DB2 on premise via JDBC Sink connector

This scenario is using the [IBM Kafka Connect sink connector for JDBC](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/kafka-connect-jdbc-sink) to get data from the `inventory topic` and write records to the `inventory` table in DB2. This lab explain the definition of the connector and how to run an integration test that sends data to the inventory topic.

### Pre-requisites

As a pre-requisite you need to have a [DB2 instance on cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Db2onCloud?topic=Db2onCloud-getting-started) up and running with defined credentials. From the credentials you need the username, password and the `ssljdbcurl` parameter. Something like "jdbc:db2://dashdb-tx....net:50001/BLUDB:sslConnection=true;".

1. Build and deploy the `inventory-app`. This application is a simple Java microprofile 3.3 app exposing a set of end points for cRUD operations on stores, items and inventory. It is based on [Quarkus](https:quarkus.io). The instructions to build, and deploy this app is in the [README](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/eda-kconnect-lab/tree/master/inventory-app) under the `inventory-app` folder of [this repository](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/eda-kconnect-lab). At the application starts stores and items records are uploaded to the database.

1. Verify the stores and items records are loaded

  * If you deploy the `inventory-app` from previous step, then you will have the database created and populated with some stores and items automatically. If you want to drop the data use [the drop sql script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbcodeforce/eda-kconnect-lab/master/inventory-app/src/main/resources/drop.sql) and then reload them the [insert sql script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbcodeforce/eda-kconnect-lab/master/inventory-app/src/main/resources/import.sql) from `inventory-app/src/main/resources` folder. For that you can use the `Run sql` menu in the DB2 console:

  ![DB1](./images/db2-1.png)

  Select the database schema matching the username used as credential, and then open the SQL editor:

  ![DB2](./images/db2-2.png)

  Verify the items with `select * from items;`
  
   ![DB2](./images/db2-3.png)

  Verify the stores with `select * from stores;`

  ![DB2](./images/db2-4.png)

  The inventory has one record to illustrate the relationship between store, item and inventory.

### Run the Kafka Connector in distributed mode

The docker image built in the [setup](#scenario-setup) has the configuration for kafka connect distributed cluster, we need in this scenario to start the connector and upload the DB2 Sink connector definition. To start it, run the script `./createOrStartKconnect.sh start` under `kconnect` folder.

### Upload the DB2 sink definition

Rename the file `db2-sink-config-TMPL.json` as `db2-sink-config.json` and modify the DB2 server URL, DB2 username and password. The DB schema matches the user name, so update this setting for the `table.name.format`.

```json
  "name": "jdbc-sink-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "com.ibm.eventstreams.connect.jdbcsink.JDBCSinkConnector",
    "tasks.max": "1",
    "topics": "inventory",
    "connection.url": "jdbc:db2://....services.dal.bluemix.net:50001/BLUDB:sslConnection=true;",
    "connection.user": "<username>",
    "connection.password": "<password>",
    "connection.ds.pool.size": "1",
    "insert.mode.databaselevel": "true",
    "table.name.format": "<username>.INVENTORY"
  }
```

Once done, you can run the `./sendJdbcSinkConfig.sh url-kafka-connect` to upload the above definition to the Kafka connect controller. When running locally the command is `./sendJdbcSinkConfig.sh localhodt:8083`. This script delete previously define connector with the same name, and then perform a POST operation on the `/connectors` end point.

The connector trace should have something like:

```logs
connector.class = com.ibm.eventstreams.connect.jdbcsink.JDBCSinkConnector
 	errors.log.enable = false
 	errors.log.include.messages = false
 	errors.retry.delay.max.ms = 60000
 	errors.retry.timeout = 0
 	errors.tolerance = none

### Generate some records

The `integration-tests` folder includes a set of python code to load some records to the expected topic.

1. Start a python environment with `./startPython.sh`
1. Within the bash, start python to execute the  `ProduceInventoryEvent.py` script, and specify the number of records to send via the --size argument.

```
python ProduceInventoryEvent.py --size 2
```
1. The trace should have something like

```
Produce to the topic inventory
[KafkaProducer] - This is the configuration for the producer:
[KafkaProducer] - {'bootstrap.servers': 'broker-0-qnprtqnp7hnkssdz.kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-1-qnprtqnp7hnkssdz.kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-2-qnprtqnp7hnkssdz.kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-3-qnprtqnp7hnkssdz.kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-4-qnprtqnp7hnkssdz.kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-5-qnprtqnp7hnkssdz.kafka.svc01.us-east.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093', 'group.id': 'ProducerInventory', 'acks': 0, 'request.timeout.ms': 10000, 'security.protocol': 'SASL_SSL', 'sasl.mechanisms': 'PLAIN', 'sasl.username': 'token', 'sasl.password': 'am_rbb9e794mMwhE-KGPYo0hhW3h91e28OhT8IlruFe5'}

```

### Verify records are uploaded into the Inventory database

Using the DB2 console, use the `select * from inventory;` SQL query to get the last records.

## Scenario 4: Run the solution components end to end on Kubernetes

* [DB2 instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Db2onCloud?topic=Db2onCloud-getting-started).
* [IBM Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_cluster_tutorial#cs_cluster_tutorial).

1. Verify the Store Sale Simulator runs
1. Verify the connectors `http://localhost:8083/connectors`
To be terminated !
